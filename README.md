## Why?

My micro USB cable seems to be slightly damaged so every time I move my phone while it is charging through my Mac's USB port, it thinks a new Android device was just plugged in and starts the Android File Transfer application. And I've gotten tired of having to click 'OK' every time to close the error message and Android File Transfer.
